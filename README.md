# Machine-teaching-for-robots
This project report will explore the optimal teaching that can be given to robots to enable them to learn and
perform useful dynamic motor skills. This project teaches two motor skills to a two-link arm to assess its
learning performance. The teaching was done in the form of training data given to the learner (i.e., two-link
arm) modelled in MATLAB for multiple trials to obtaining a large set of results to increase the reliability of
the data. The results obtained through the experiments support the defined optimality condition, optimal
training data given to the learner can optimise their learning performance in learning the desired motor skill.
